                        <p>Doug was very responsive.
I received a call from him almost immediately after requesting a quote. Instead of going through all the ins and outs of scheduling an onsite quote visit, he was able to use today's readily available technology to view our house via the web and offer a quote right then and there.
Doug offered PayPal as a form of payment which I'm sure made invoicing and payment processing a breeze.
He even washed the front of our home for free! (it needed it)
He offered me a quote to complete the siding wash at another date should I choose to and I thought that was awesome.
I would recommend Doug and Jen PowerWashing over any other roof washing service in the area!</p>

                        <p>I found JEN via Angie's List, and they absolutely lived up to the good reviews. We hired Doug to wash both my house and my mother's, and we're both very pleased. Doug stayed in touch and returned calls promptly while we worked through scheduling a convenient time for all. Both houses look great, the gutters look new, and he was also able to even out a bit of faded siding on one house.
Not really much else to add, other than that I will certainly be calling them again the next time the house needs washing. Thanks, Doug!</p>

                        <p>Very well! He cleaned dirt that the last two powerwashes did not get. Doug got our window sills cleaner than they've been in years.

                        <p>Contacted them via phone, I was ok with them stopping by to look at the job when I was not home, so they did and called me back with a price. I told them it was a good price and wanted to go with it, and he said they would add me to the list and let me know when they could get to it, we were not in any rush. They called one morning to ask if "Today" would be a good day since it was nice out and they had the time, I said sure but I was not home. They were ok with that, so when I got home from work it was all done and looked AWESOME. He called back the next day to ask how we liked it and to set up a time for payment. All in all it was a great experience, house looks great and we would use them again and recommend them to anyone.</p>

                        <p style="border-top-left-radius: 0px;">The entire experience was fantastic, from start to finish.  Doug was very responsive when I made the inquiry about having the house washed.  He even found my house on Google Street View and was able to give me a "high-low" estimate over the phone.  He told me what I needed to do before he arrived (make sure windows were closed and outdoor faucet was turned on, etc.).  Upon arriving at the house, he gave me the exact cost, which was toward the lower end of the high-low range.  He told me approximately how long the process would take, and he was exactly right.  Most importantly, he did a meticulous and thorough job on the house, garage, and fence.  Everything looks so much better!  He even pointed out some things that I should be aware of, such as artillery fungus spores on the siding.  That was certainly going above and beyond what he needed to do.  On top of that, he's an exceptionally personable guy.  In summary, this was a great price for an excellent service by an obviously thoughtful and hard-working man who takes a lot of pride in his work.  I highly recommend Jen Pressure Washing.  Aces all around.</p>

                        <p>Doug pressure washed a two story home with an additional walk out basement. He arrived at the
time he said he would and he completed the work in a timely manner while remaining accurate and
efficient. He did a tremendous job and the home looks new. He even cleaned all of the windows (and there are 34 of them).</p>

                        <p>Doug washed the whole house, garage, and porches on our two-story, historic home in downtown Northampton. Doug and his crew did a terrific job!  He was reliable and took great care.  The house looks great, and his prices were competitive.  We wouldn't hesitate to use him again.</p>

                        <p>It came out great!  my siding looks brand new.  Doug even had to order special soap to clean the outside of the gutters which turned gray.  He came back to my house as soon as the special soap was in and finished the job!

                        <p>I found JEN via Angie's List, and they absolutely lived up to the good reviews. We hired Doug to wash both my house and my mother's, and we're both very pleased. Doug stayed in touch and returned calls promptly while we worked through scheduling a convenient time for all. Both houses look great, the gutters look new, and he was also able to even out a bit of faded siding on one house.
Not really much else to add, other than that I will certainly be calling them again the next time the house needs washing. Thanks, Doug!</p>
